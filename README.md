### Hi there! I'm Alexandre Guimarães 👋

#### About Me
I'm a Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on efficient and scalable web solutions. I currently work at **Art Kamizetas**, where I independently manage all things tech — from internal tooling, dashboards and digital campaigns.

Although I work across the full stack, I’m most passionate about the **back-end**, where I’ve been deepening my expertise in automation, data structures, and scalable systems.

I'm driven by curiosity, autonomy, and a love for solving real-world problems through technology.

#### 🧠 Soft Skills
- Independent and self-managed
- Passionate about learning and solving challenges
- Enthusiastic and proactive
- Comfortable working both in a team and independently
- Always exploring and experimenting with new technologies

#### 🚀 Current Stack
- 💡 **Languages**: `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`
- 🔙 **Back-end**: `Node.js`, `Express`, `Fastify`, `Knex.js`, `Prisma`, `SQL`, `Supabase`, `Docker`, `GCP`, `Postgres`
- 🌐 **Front-end**: `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `JavaScript`, `React.js`
- 🧪 **Testing**: `Jest`, `Vitest`, `Cypress`
- 🧩 **Tools**: `Figma`, `Git & GitHub`, `VS Code`, `Markdown`, `Google Apps Script`, `Looker Studio`

#### 🔬 What I'm Exploring
- Automating sales tracking through dashboards and Supabase
- Building product showcase pages and campaign landing pages
- **Integrating ERPs** like **Tiny** and **Bling**:
  - Tiny via **Edge Functions** and **webhooks** to keep the database always up-to-date
  - Bling integration through authenticated API requests using OAuth 2.0, enabling custom data synchronization.

#### 🎯 Next Steps
