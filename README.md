### Hi there! I'm Alexandre Guimarães 👋

#### About Me
I'm a Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on efficient and scalable web solutions. I currently work at **Art Kamizetas**, where I independently manage all things tech — from internal tooling and dashboards to e-commerce and digital campaigns.

Although I work across the full stack, I’m most passionate about the **back-end**, where I’ve been deepening my expertise in automation, data structures, and scalable systems.

I'm driven by curiosity, autonomy, and a love for solving real-world problems through technology.
